                Good you're asking.
                <br>
                To get straight to the point, this dApp proofs that your Ethereum Account is acctually an EAO (or Externally Owned Account) and NOT a smart contract.
                Let that sink in for a moment.
                <br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>Why build this tool?</h1>
            <p>
                Now, you and your friends obviously know the difference between a user and a smart contract. 
                Other smart contracts, though, have troubles telling them apart. 
                This results in a more-complex-than-necessary user experience, as well as unnecessary development burdens.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1>What is this useful for?</h1>
            <p>
                Soulbound Tokens for example. 
                When only EAOs are allowed to hold some token, it is possible to make them actually non transferable. 
                Imagine one could buy a degree in some subject without going to university.
                Sounds stupid, but without a system like Outsider unavoidable on Ethereum.

        <div class="text">
            <h1>How does Outsider help?</h1>
            <p>
                To verify that some address is in fact an EOA, developers need to recover a public key from a so called ECDSA signature.
                While not as complicated as it sounds, this is not exactly trivial to implement. 
                <br>
                Outsider hides this logic and thereby reduces the difficulty to a singular, copy-and-pastable, line of code.
                <br>
                This means multiple things:
                <br>
                <br>
                A) (New) Users are a little bit less overwhelmed by all this arguably cryptic software.
                <br>
                <br>
                B) The end product is more secure.
                <br>
                <br>
                C) Developers can spend more time on actually building innovative software.

            <h1>Awesome! How can I use this in my dApp?</h1>
            <p>
                That's easy. Visit <a href="https://github.com/SirSupersecret/outsider">this</a> GitHub repo.
                Here you will find all the information you need.
                (Though, at the moment, the documentation is a work in progress)
            </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h1>Help?!</h1>
            <p>
                In case you were directed to this website, just press the three buttons one after another. 
                Also follow any instructions your wallet software presents.
                <br>
                <br>
                In case you have any questions, shoot me a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/SirSupersecret" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, if you want to see this protocol on more chains, with the same address everywhere, feel free to donate some network native tokens to:
                <br>
                0x07aCb828Cbe003C4D0CE9746BDdd4dB64799c0e3
                <br>
                Also Etherum mainnet is currently too friggin expensive for me (or at least I think so)...
